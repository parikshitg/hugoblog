<p>While there are a lot of pros in developing software for use on the web, there are some cons as well. These can be unique challenges to a web developer.</p>

<h2>Load times</h2>
<p>Do you ever go to a website and it takes forever to load? What is your reaction? We usually get frustrated and leave. In fact, most users will leave a site if it does not load for them in 15 seconds or less! As mentioned earlier, connection speed is a large hurdle to overcome when dealing with web development. A userâ€™s speed can range from very fast (Fiber optic) to slow (mobile 3G or satellite). It is our job as web developers to take ALL users into account. Therefore, we learn tricks to keep users engaged while our code is being downloaded, and learn to keep our code small so it can be easily downloaded.</p>

<h2>Different Browsers</h2>
<p> Not only do we have to worry about load times, but also differences in browser technology. Mobile browsers are different than desktop (or laptop) browsers. Older browsers (many computers still use Windows XP and IE9) are extremely different than newer browsers, and developing for each provides a unique challenge. Ultimately you will need to make sacrifices and not support some browsers (which is a call marketing department will make) but you should be able to code for the browser you do support.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2><p> If you are not a person that uses an accessibility device to consume software on the web, then you may have no idea these exist. Screen readers, alternative keyboards/navigation devices, devices for the hearing impaired, the color blind, font sizes for visually impaired people, are all concepts that we tend to not think about. As a web developer, you will need to start thinking about these users not only from a human decency perspective, but also because these users make up a non-insignificant market share. There are also legal issues that require accessibility.</p>
