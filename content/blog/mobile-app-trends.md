<p>Technology is always evolving, but since the dawn of smartphones (which started back in 1994 with its first launch for the general public), it witnessed nothing but growth and along the way, smartphones have become an integral part of our everyday lives.</p>
<p>According to Statista, there are 2.1 billion mobile users now and in 2019 the number is predicted to surpass 5 billion — it is said that this year’s trends will be a sequel of how things looked like back in 2018.
So based on the last year, what are the trends we can expect to see in 2019?</p>

<h2>1. Instant Apps</h2>
<p>Basically, instant apps don’t require you to download and install them on your phone. They are smaller in size when compared to regular apps and still have the basic functionalities of a website.</p>
<p>Considering the amount of the phone’s memory that regular apps consume, people would be more prone to use instant apps and thus save their memory space for other things.
In a nutshell, they give a great user experience without consuming your phone’s memory.</p>

<h2>2. Internet of Things (IoT)</h2>
<p>IoT is still growing rapidly over the past few years and it is more to come. Worldwide businesses have already started leveraging the power of interconnected devices. The latest developments enabled us to control a variety of devices using our smartphones (smart home, connected cars tracking deliveries in transportation etc.) and it’s an excellent way to serve a wide range of purposes.</p>
<p>The applications in IoT in mobile app development will be more disruptive in the coming years and among all industries, healthcare will be the most interested in adopting of IoT for mobile apps.</p>

<h2>3. Mobile Payment</h2>
<p>Today, most consumers are shopping and making payments through mobile (Google Pay, Paytm) as opposed to the past years. According to Businesswire, the global mobile wallet market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 30% until 2026.</p>
<p>Taking into account the ongoing growth of mobile commerce and consumer preference for m-wallets, people will more and more turn to this type of payment and we can expect to see more mobile payment apps throughout this year.</p>

<h2>4. Wearables</h2>
<p>According to Statista, wearable device sales revenue will skyrocket from almost 34 billions in 2018 to unbelievable forecasted 73 billions in 2022.</p>
<p>When speaking of healthcare, there’s been a considerable rise in sales of wearable devices as more and more people invest in their personal health management. Wearables help them to track their progress by updating them on the vital information: calories burnt, heart rate, blood pressure and so on. You can set up reminders for water intake or sleep pattern information which can assist you to lead a healthy life.</p>
<p>Considering the growth, it will be soon that wearables will become a must-have accessory especially that they are becoming more affordable.</p>

<h2>5. AR/VR</h2>
<p>Augmented and Virtual Reality are technologies that deliver a more realistic experience to the users. In marketing, people use it to promote their brand and target the customers, whilst in the gaming industry, it’s quite common for some time now.</p>
<p>In the coming years, more businesses will include AR/VR technology so to engage with their customers better or to facilitate the buying process; also mobile apps will be developed with such AR/VR elements so to make social media campaigns more interactive. So far, we’ve seen Instagram and Snapchat being the first to integrate AR filters in that area.</p>

<h2>6. Chatbots</h2>
<p>Here’s the topic that has proven effective since providing the users or customers with personalized responses to their questions in real time. Firstly, bots were largely used in messaging apps like Facebook, Slack, Skype etc. but the evolution in the AI domain made it easy to integrate chatbots into the native mobile apps.</p>
<p>They can greatly improve the functionality of mobile apps — the conversational interface increases user engagement and drives app adoption as well as the app becomes more accurate in delivering results.</p>
<p>There are many examples of chatbots (Duolingo, Whole Foods etc.) that are or can be a future success.</p>

<h2>7. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)</h2>
<p>AI has been a dominant technology for quite some time and will continue that way. The benefits are enormous — analyzing massive amounts of organizational data and providing the valuable insights to business management.</p>
<p>AI and ML can help in building smarter mobile apps that can give the users a more personalized experience thus increasing user adoption and retention.
We will witness AI and ML redefining the mobile app development process in the years to come.</p>

<h2>8. Blockchain</h2>
<p>Well, this is one of the major technological disruptions when thinking about impact on mobile app development — it brought things to another level of security and transparency in all types of digital transactions.
Blockchain quickly got adopted in the financial services and supply chain apps. Businesses like retail, financial services and healthcare are one of the first ones to use the benefits of blockchain when building their mobile apps.</p>
