<p>People are always looking for ways to make their lives simpler and more convenient, especially when it comes to travel. One of the keys to traveling is packing light, however, it is absolutely essential to carry all the essentials. We always remember our daily necessities like chargers, laptops, selfie sticks, cameras, iPods, etc., but tend to forget not-so-common yet very important things.</p>

<p>I have created a list of things that I feel are very important:</p>

<ul>
	<li> <b>If you are an Adventurer</b> — A GoPro camera to carry with you to capture all your rafting, skydiving, trekking, bungee jumping, etc. experiences to create memories for yourself and to also share with others.</li>
	<li> <b>Toiletry/Makeup Bags</b> — It is always recommended to pack different bags/pouches for medicines, makeup, in-flight essentials, and toiletries.</li>
	<li><b>Multi-Country Travel Adapter with USB Sockets</b>  — It’s one of those things that are vital yet most of us always forget (tip: keep it in your suitcase so it’s always there!). Rather than having to find out what type of plug the country you are visiting has, just take a multi-travel adapter so that no matter what country you are from or wherever you are traveling to its bound to fit. </li>
	<li><b>Laundry Bag</b>— It helps you to separate worn clothes from unworn clothes. Also, if you are planning a long trip and traveling light it can be a great savior.</li>
	<li><b>Scarf/Light Jacket</b>— Always carry a scarf or a light jacket along for any weather uncertainties that may arise. It can serve as a great accessory and at the same time be extremely versatile.</li>
</ul>
