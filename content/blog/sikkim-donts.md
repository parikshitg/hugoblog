<p>The key to doing something successfully is knowing what need not to be done. And this same theory can be applied when planning a trip.</p>

<p>Sikkim, one of India’s most scenic destinations, promises to deliver you a satiating experience. However, even then, there are few don’ts that you should not do when planning a trip to this state.</p>

<h2>Here are few of those don’ts:</h2>

<h2>Late Booking</h2>
<p>Sikkim is a very touristy place with thousands of people booking travels and accommodations well in advance. If you’re reserving your spot late, stay ready to either be disappointed or spend extravagantly.</p>

<h2>Cheap accommodation</h2>
<p>You’re going to be spending one of the best days of your life here. So, don’t stick to your miser habits — be modest in your spending. There are many hotels in East Sikkim. Some are cheap, others are expensive. Find the right balance between these two ends.
There are few very good hotels near M.G.Marg in Gangtok that are affordably lavish. Pick nice rooms. If budget allows, go for the suite. Enjoy a luxurious accommodation with a mesmerizing view from the window.</p>

<h2>Don’t micro-plan everything</h2>
<p>Planning your travels always help. But if you’re doing this obsessively and minutely scheduling everything, you’re only limiting all the possible fun. Stop planning when you will get up, how much time you will spend in the restaurant and shopping, and which parks you will visit.</p>
<p>Carry that spontaneity with you where you plan as you go. It will add more thrill and excitement to your trip.</p>
<p>These are 3 don’ts for when planning your trip to Sikkim. This is a great place, jeweled with marvel. Make sure to enjoy yourself… and oh, click loads of selfies.</p>
