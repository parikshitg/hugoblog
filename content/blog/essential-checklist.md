<p>This is a simple launch checklist for web and mobile apps that Iâ€™ve prepared for product and project managers to quickly test performance of their apps. It also includes a list of commonly overlooked simple mobile app tests to confirm that the app behaves as expected.
Product managers on the client side can use the tools provided to see performance results when working with digital agencies or dev shops.</p>

<h2>Web Applications</h2>
<p>For web applications, the launch check list should cover the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance: Pass Google Page Speed Insights Test</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Broken Links</li>
<li>Compatibility</li>
<li>SEO / Social</li>
</ul>

<h3>Performance: Pass Google Page Speed Insights Test</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Plug the site into <b>Google PageSpeed Insights</b> to see your results</li>
	<li>If the site requires login / credentials, login to the site first and check the performance with <b>Chrome Page Speed Insights Extension</b>
	</li>
	<li>Another useful tool is Pass <b>GTMetrix Analysis</b></li>
</ul>

<h3>Security</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Use HTTPS only. HTTP should always redirect to HTTPS.</li>
	<li>Qualys SSL Server Test - Aim for a score of A and above</b>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Check compatibility with major desktop browsers and their versions (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer)</li>
	<li>Check mobile browsers too!
	</li>
	<li>Also, check how Safari (iOS) and Chrome (Android) perform on various screen sizes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>SEO / Social Media</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Is it fetched correctly by Google?</li>
	<li>Is it in the first page of Google Search Results Pages (SERPs)?
	</li>
	<li>Does it contain correct OpenGraph tags for social sharing? Test by dropping the link into Facebook / Twitter / Pinterest to see what image, title, and description is generated</li>
	<li>Does the site or app have the correct Title / Meta Description Tag?</li>
	<li>Does it have a Favicon?</li>
</ul>
